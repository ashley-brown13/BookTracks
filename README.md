BookTracks, a Bandcamp clone, allows users to upload and find their favorite playlists for books. Inspired by my reading of independent books in which authors list the songs they listened to while writing the book, I wanted to design an application where everyone can list the songs they like for novels.

## Technologies
* Express
* Bcrypt
* React
* Redux
* Sequelize

I used Sequelize and Express to design the backend, and React and Redux to build the frontend. Bcrypt helped keep by database secure by hashing user passwords before storage. In addition to the technologies noted above, I utilized the Google Books API to get the book information and images.
